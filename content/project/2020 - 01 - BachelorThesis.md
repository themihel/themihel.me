Description: "<strong>Development of an infrastructure to analyze the influence of design patterns on the use of Instagram:</strong> Social networks like Instagram are omnipresent in today's society. Accordingly, the question arises why apps of these networks are used so intensively and frequently. Thus, the goal of this thesis is to create an infrastructure for the analysis of the influence of design patterns on Instagram. Besides the development of a technical basis, theoretical models are presented. In addition to the design pattern itself, the user and his habits in relation to social networks will be considered. A first study, based on the created infrastructure, shows that even the lack of a few design patterns has a great influence on the usage time. These findings are supported and evaluated by the theoretical analysis. The developed infrastructure is designed in such a way that it can be used for further studies and iteratively developed."
