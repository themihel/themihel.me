## Development

As I personally tend to forget the following, here are some small development docs.

### Install

- Install dependencies via `npm install`
- Add SANITY credentials to `.env` file
  - `SANITY_TOKEN=<Your Token>`

### Local dev server

Run `npm run develop`, that's it.

In case of some caching problems you can run `npm run clean`.
